* A matrix has rows and columns i.e., m x n
* A vector is a special matrix with m x 1 i.e., a matrix with one columm but any number of rows
* MAtrix multiplication
	* Not commutative i.e., A*B != B*A
	* Associative ie., (A*B)*C == A*(B*C)
* The transposition of a matrix is like rotating the matrix once clockwise and then reversing it
* a:=b assignment and a=b assertion
